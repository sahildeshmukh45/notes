Inheritance is like parent and child child class have properties from parent class
child class means it has properties of parents class plus it has some properties of its own
the syntax is public class childclass-name extends parentclass-name{}

1> Single inheritance
in single inheritance one class extends another class 

2> multilevel inheritance
super keyword call there upper class for example if we have 3 class a b and c
b is parent of c and a is parent of b then c will call b and b will call a


3> Multiple Inheritance
in multiple inheritance one class extends more than one class 
here one child can have more than one parentclass if parentclass have same variable name and different values then which one to access thats why java doesn't support multiple inheritance

4>Hierarchical one parent can have multiple child like from a b and c 
we can extend b and c from a 

5> Hybrid inheritance it is combination of single and multiple inheritance
but in java there is no multiple inheritance so there is no hybrid inheritance either

if we didn't write super keyword it will automatically going to called super keyword of constructor which doesn't contain any parameter
like constructor with empty parameter like super(); and if parent class doesn't have constructor with no argument it will give compile time error.
