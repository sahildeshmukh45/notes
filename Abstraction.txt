Abstraction & interfaces
abstraction can be achieved by abstract classes and interfaces

1>A method without body is known as abstract method 
2>A method must always be declared in abstract class or we can say that if a class has an 
abstract method then that class should be declared as abstract as well but is it is not necessary that
abstract class should only contain abstract methods 
3>if any class inherit the abstract class then it is compulsory to make body of abstract method to that class if we don't make body then it will give error 
4>we cannot  create object of abstract class because there is no body in abstract class but can create 
reference type same like inheritance

interface is used to achieved abstraction
it support multiple interface as we know java doesn't support 
we implements multiple interfaces to multiple inheritance in inheritance, we cannot inherit more than one class so multiple inheritance is not allowed ,but we can implement more than one
interfaces it is act like multiple inheritance, interfaces is similar to abstraction like interfaces does not contain body
we have to declare all the method and function where we implement the interfaces
