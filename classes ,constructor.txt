OOP notes: On classes Objects and Constructor
Class is templates of object
Object is instance of class
variable inside the object known as instance variable
object are store in heap memory
refernce variable are store in stack memory
constructor doest have return type because the type of class is return type
constructor or function overloading can avoid by changing no of arguments or changing datatype
this keyword is used to refer to current object
if we call final for primitive we cant reassign values but for methods(Non primitive) we can reassign values but cant redecleared the function
constructor should have same name to the class
one class can have many constructor but parameter should have different
same goes for methods one class can have many methods but parameter should be different

final keyword is use to prevent your content to be modified if we decleared (finale int num=5;)
then num cannot be modified and always initialised while declared finale you cannot declared first
and then initialised that will give error

if non primitve is final then it cannot be reassign like 
finale Student user=new Student("sahil");
user.name="saurabh";
but you can't reassign like 
user=new Student("op1"); it will give error because you declared user as finale
