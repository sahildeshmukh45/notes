OOP Notes:-Packages ,Static ,singleton class , in built method
we can create different different package for create same class name
also static means which is common to all the objects present in that class 
for example if we create human class then age  salary name would be different for the different different object but 
population will be the same so we decleared population as static
also we should write classname insted of object name or this because its common for all the class 
we can also give object name or this but its not recommended	
check in the static example in kunal Kushwaha oop concepts
we can call static method without callin object because it does not depend upon any object	


Main method is static because the veryfirst thing which is going to run in the code is main
and we know every class have to make an object then how it is possible to run code without making an object of that
class therefor the main method is static where we dont need to make an object for that  
you should be run main function without create obect for class main that is why main is static 


also the this keyword is not use in static because it is refer to an object and we know static run without object
