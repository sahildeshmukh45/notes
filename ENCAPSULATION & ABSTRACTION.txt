ENCAPSULATION
encapsulation and abstraction focuses on security
inheritance and polymorphism focuses on code reusability

Encapsulation means wrapping up the implementation  of data members and methods in class 
Encapsulation means hiding data using public, private, protected keywords
you can hide data using getter and setter that is meant by encapsulation 
Encapsulation means internal working and abstraction means external showing and gaining information
Data hiding is achieved by encapsulation

 1> if we declare variable or method as private then we can only call that in that class but by creating getter and setter
 2> method we can access and modify it anywhere if we declare variable or method as protected then we can only access in subclass which are extended from that class
 3> we can also access in another package but in only subclass that are extended from the that parent class in which the protected is declare
 4> public means we can access it anywhere
 5> no modifier can only access in the same package
6> getClass() is use for acess all the feature of that class and also to get the name of class
